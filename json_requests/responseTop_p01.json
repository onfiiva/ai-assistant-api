What the name stands for:\n*   **Large:** It has been fed a massive amount of data—nearly everything written on the internet (books, articles, websites, and computer code).\n*   **Language:** Its primary job is to understand, write, and communicate in human languages.\n*   **Model:** It is a complex mathematical \"map\" or program that identifies patterns in how words relate to each other.\n\n### 2. How does it work?\nAn LLM doesn't actually \"know\" facts or have a brain. Instead, it is a **prediction engine.**\n\nImagine I say: *\"The cat sat on the...\"*\nYour brain immediately thinks of the word *\"mat\"* or *\"floor.\"* An LLM does the same thing, but on a much larger scale. Because it has read billions of sentences",
